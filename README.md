As a  graduate student, I took a higher-level computation course, as well as an electrical engineering and design course:
- [Graduate Computational Physics](https://github.com/ninoc0/phy_607)
- [Discrete and Integrated Analog Electronic Circuits]

## Personal Projects
I have also worked on many personal projects in my free time, which can be found here:
- [Computational SIR Model](https://github.com/ninoc0/Computational_SIR_Model)
- [Uber Data Analysis](https://github.com/ninoc0/Uber-Data-Analysis)
